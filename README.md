## Introduction

Days on Market (DoM) analysis is a critical metric in real estate, offering insights into market conditions, buyer and seller behaviors, and broader economic trends. This project employs data science techniques to analyze and forecast DoM, housing prices, and inventory levels.

## Research Questions

1. What impact does DoM have on listings across various regions?
2. How do economic indicators shape DoM trends?
3. How do seasonal variations affect DoM?
4. To what extent do local market conditions influence DoM?
5. What impact do marketing strategies have on DoM?
6. How do external factors like policy changes or global events affect DoM?

## Approach

The project follows a structured approach:
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical and predictive modeling
- Advanced visualization

## Dataset

The analysis uses real estate market datasets, including property characteristics, economic indicators, and location specifics. The datasets are cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to understand DoM dynamics.

## Required Packages

The project utilizes several R packages:
- `tidyverse` (including `tidyr` and `dplyr`) for data preparation and cleaning
- `ggplot2` for visualization
- `caret` for predictive modeling
- `forecast` for time series analysis

## Plots and Tables

The project includes various visualizations:
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Heat maps
- Time series decomposition plots
- Geographic visualizations

Tables present statistical metrics such as R-squared and RMSE.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA reveals valuable insights into the U.S. housing market:
- **Housing Inventory Over Time**: Fluctuations and trends in housing inventory
- **Median Days on Market Over Time**: Seasonal patterns and market conditions
- **Housing Price Index Over Time**: Long-term trends in housing prices

## Conclusions

The analysis indicates both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in the housing market. The findings provide actionable insights for various stakeholders, including investors, real estate professionals, and policymakers.
